Repository for the paper "Within-host viral growth and immune response rates predict FMDV transmission dynamics for African Buffalo"

Folders in this repository are: <br />
  1. Archive
  2. Finalized fitting
  3. Output analysis 

The <ins> Archive </ins> folder contains previous versions of the model fitting, including efforts to fit time series data, such as SAA data for innate immune response, which was not part of the finalized analysis.  Most users will want to look instead at the <ins> Finalized fitting </ins> and <ins> Output analysis </ins> folders.

The <ins> Finalized fitting </ins> folder contains the (i) finalized code for model fitting as described in the methods section and SI of the paper, (ii) the input experimental data formatted to work with this code, (iii) the code to generate parameter confidence intervals for both the needle and contact-infected hosts, (iv) the code to generate the time plots shown in figures 2 and S3 of the manuscript, (v) output parameters in .mat format.
